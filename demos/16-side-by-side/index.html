                ishing boats illuminate the Arabian Sea along India’s west 
                coast with green lights designed to attract squid, shrimp, 
                sardines, and mackerel in this nighttime photograph from the 
                International Space Station, orbiting 259 miles above Earth. 
                At lower right, the city lights of Hyderabad—renowned for its 
                historic diamond and pearl trade—stretch westward toward the 
                Mumbai Metropolitan Region, home to over 26 million people 
                and the heart of Bollywood.
