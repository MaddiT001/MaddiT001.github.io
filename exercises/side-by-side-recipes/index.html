                These banana French toast muffins are soft, golden, and packed
                 with cozy banana bread flavor in every bite. They’re baked all
                 at once instead of cooked slice by slice, making them perfect
                 for meal prep and busy mornings. Warm them up and finish 
                 with maple syrup and/or powdered sugar for an easy, 
                 comforting breakfast.
