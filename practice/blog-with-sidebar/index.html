                    Appearance and Size: 
                    Sexy shrimp are very small, 
                    typically less than 2 cm (0.8 inches) in length, with 
                    females slightly larger than males. They have a 
                    translucent brown body adorned with white or blue spots 
                    outlined in dark brown, and their abdomen is 
                    characteristically curved upwards with the tail fan 
                    above the head, giving them their "sexy" appearance. 
                    They have short-stalked, protruding eyes and jointed 
                    limbs typical of arthropods

                    Habitat and Distribution:
                    Sexy shrimp are circumtropical, found in shallow coral 
                    reefs across the Indo-Pacific, Red Sea, Caribbean, and 
                    parts of the Atlantic, including the Canary Islands and 
                    Bahamas. They typically live among the tentacles of sea 
                    anemones or mushroom corals, forming a commensal 
                    relationship where the shrimp gain protection and the host
                    benefits from cleaning of trapped plankton and debris.
                    Occasionally, they can be found free-living in dead 
                    corals, rock crevices, or biogenic gravel.
