             <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</b>,<sup[1]> 
             <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup[2]> or inter-crown spacing<sup[3]>) is  
             a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of 
             fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy 
             with channel-like gaps. <sup[4][5]> Thephenomenon is most 
             prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between 
             trees of different species.<sup[6][7]> There exist many hypotheses 
             as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research 
             suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect
              larvae.<sup[8]>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sup[6]> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature 
            since the 1920s.<sup[9]> The variety of hypotheses and experimental
             results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across
              different species, an example of <sup convergent evolution.

              Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy
              branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees:
              trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide
              with each other during <sup winds>; the abrasions and collisions 
              induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral 
              branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until
              disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup[10]> If the crowns are 
              artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they 
              gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup[11]> This explains instances
              of crown shyness between branches of the same organism.
              Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly 
              seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy 
              forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests
              where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.
              <sup[6][12]> According to this theory, variable flexibility in 
              lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
